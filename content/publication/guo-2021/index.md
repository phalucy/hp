abstract: Recent works have revealed that the wintertime atmospheric river (AR) activity
  is closely related to the 30–60-day tropical intraseasonal variability, yet it remains
  unclear whether summertime AR activity is also significantly influenced by intraseasonal
  variability, often referred to as the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO).
  Diagnosing the 40-yr (1979–2018) ERA5 reanalysis dataset, the present study examines
  the climatological features of ARs over the Indo-Pacific region during June–October
  and its associations with the BSISO. Results suggest that the western North Pacific
  subtropical high (WNPSH) provides a favorable circulation background for the summertime
  AR activity, which conveys the moisture from the tropics to the midlatitude North
  Pacific along its periphery. Our analysis reveals that the BSISO has substantial
  impacts on the occurrence and distribution of ARs. More ARs are found over the western
  North Pacific (WNP) when the BSISO convective envelope propagates northward to the
  subtropical regions, while fewer ARs can be seen when convection is suppressed there.
  Specifically, in phases 7–8, the active BSISO convection over the Philippine Sea
  induces a low pressure anomaly and the corresponding anomalous cyclonic circulation,
  leading to the enhanced poleward moisture transport and more frequent AR activity
  over the WNP. Moreover, the WNP ARs tend to be longer and have larger sizes during
  these two phases. It is also found that more frequent occurrence of tropical cyclones
  in phases 7–8 can significantly enhance the moisture transport and AR occurrence
  over the WNP.
