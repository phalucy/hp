abstract: 'The transport and accumulation of moisture played an essential role in
  the extremely heavy rainfall of July 2020 in Japan. To better understand this event
  in terms of moisture sources and transport routes, backward particle trajectory
  analysis was conducted. We found two major moisture sources: transport from the
  tropics and uptake from the subtropics. A narrow moisture channel was found along
  the edge of the western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), transporting the moisture
  to the Baiu front. However, most moisture from the tropics was lost due to precipitation,
  and their contributions were reduced to about 15%. In contrast, the subtropical
  regions contributed over 80% moisture via evaporation and lower tropospheric convection.
  Among those regions, the western Pacific contributed the most (> 33 %). This study
  highlights the role of WPSH in moisture transport and demonstrated the importance
  of moisture uptake during transport.'
