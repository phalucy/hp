abstract: Marine pollution can have a significant impact on the blue carbon, which
  finally affect the ocean's ability to sequester carbon and contribute to achieving
  carbon neutrality. Marine pollution is a complex problem that requires a great deal
  of time and effort to measure. Existing machine learning algorithms cannot effectively
  solve the detection time problem and provide limited accuracy. Moreover, marine
  pollution can come from a variety of sources. However, most of the existing research
  focused on a single ocean indicator to analyze marine pollution. In this study,
  two indicators, marine organisms and debris, are used to create a more complete
  picture of the extent and impact of pollution in the ocean. To effectively recognize
  different marine objects in the complex marine environment, we propose an integrated
  data fusion approach where deep CNNs are combined to conduct underwater object recognition.
  Through this multi-source data fusion approach, the accuracy of object recognition
  is significantly improved. After feature extraction, four machine and deep learning
  classifiers' performances are used to train on features extracted with deep CNNs.
  The results show that VGG-16 achieves better performance than other feature extractors
  when detecting marine organisms. When detecting marine debris, AlexNet outperforms
  other deep CNNs. The results also show that the LSTM classifier with VGG-16 for
  detecting marine organisms outperforms other deep learning models. For detecting
  marine debris, the best performance was observed with the AlexNet extractor, which
  obtained the best classification result with an LSTM. This information can be used
  to develop policies and practices aimed at reducing pollution and protecting marine
  environments for future generations.
