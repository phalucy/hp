abstract: This study investigated the diurnal cycle of convection over Sumatra Island
  in an active phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) during the Pre-Years of
  the Maritime Continent (YMC) observation campaign in December 2015 based on in-situ
  and satellite observations and a convection-permitting numerical model. Observations
  suggest that before the active phase of the MJO in early December, convection occurred
  frequently over the island during the afternoon and at midnight. By contrast, during
  the active phase of the MJO in mid-December, afternoon convection over the island
  was delayed and suppressed, and midnight convection was suppressed. Numerical experiments
  also successfully replicated the main features of the observed modulations. In general,
  during the active phase of the MJO, the troposphere became drier in the Sumatra
  region. While the clouds reduced the solar radiation over the land, the sea breeze
  was also found to be delayed and weakened. As a result, the afternoon convection
  initiation was delayed and weakened. Further analyses suggested that the sea breeze
  was weakened mainly due to the orographic stagnation effect rather than the slightly
  reduced land-sea temperature contrast. On the other hand, the increased stratiform-anvil
  clouds induced the anomalous evaporative cooling in the mid-troposphere and generated
  island-scale subsidence during the nighttime, which finally led to the suppression
  of inland convection. Overall, our study reveals the modulation of diurnal convection
  over Sumatra Island by an active phase of the MJO and also shows the potential role
  of land-sea interaction in convection initiation and maintenance.
