abstract: In August 2022, the Tohoku region of Japan suffered three major heavy rainfall
  events, while one was related to an anticyclone, and the others were induced by
  a ‘Baiu-like’ stationary front. By using the Lagrangian backward trajectories, we
  found the moisture sources of the three events varied much due to the rapidly changing
  atmospheric conditions. In general, moisture from the Sea of Japan contributed the
  most in all events, while the western Pacific also played a certain role. Surprisingly,
  moisture from tropical storms and the East China Sea did not contribute much due
  to the along-transport precipitation. But, based on forward-traced trajectories,
  we confirmed that tropical storms did enhance moisture transport from subtropical
  regions via their southerly wind. Overall, this study highlights the role of the
  moisture gains nearby and the outer flows of tropical storms during heavy rainfalls
  in a northern region.
