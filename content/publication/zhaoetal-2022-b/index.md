abstract: Our recent study suggested that moisture from the subtropical Western Pacific
  (WP) contributed the most to an atmospheric river (AR) event and the related heavy
  rainfall during the heavy rain of 2020 in Japan based on a Lagrangian approach.
  However, the actual role of moisture from the subtropical WP region in the AR and
  heavy rain formations remains unclear. To evaluate that, we conducted a set of numerical
  sensitivity experiments by adjusting the surface moisture supply over the subtropical
  WP region with factors of 0%, 50%, and 200%. The sensitivity experiments suggest
  that the reduced surface evaporation over the subtropical WP suppressed the local
  convective activity and decreased moisture content in the whole troposphere, leading
  to shallow and weak positive geopotential height anomalies. Although the slightly
  strengthened WP subtropical High (WPSH) and related anomalous anticyclonic circulation
  enhanced the southwesterly wind, convective activities along the Meiyu-Baiu front
  were still weakened due to the largely reduced moisture supply, resulting in another
  anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Japan but had much stronger and deeper structures.
  These two anomalous circulations and the reduced moisture modulated the AR over
  Japan, which eventually caused the weakened rainfalls and the northward migration
  of the rainband. By contrast, larger surface evaporation enhanced the local convective
  activities and weakened the dominant WPSH, resulting in the weakening and the southward
  migration of the AR. Overall, this study confirmed the large contributions of moisture
  supply from the subtropical WP region to the AR and related precipitation over Japan
  during the record-breaking Meiyu-Baiu season in 2020 via both dynamic and thermodynamic
  influences. In addition, it reveals that, although larger evaporation over the WP
  region would increase the total rainfalls but would not have led to more several
  rainfalls over certain regions, such as the relatively small Kyushu Island.
