abstract: The features of the summer coastal upwelling in the southwestern Yellow
  Sea have been investigated based on a scientific cruise observations and numerical
  simulations. The observation data suggested that the relatively colder and saltier
  water core exists from the bottom to the surface along the northeastern flank of
  the Subei Bank. The surface cold water patch could be observed frequently. Additionally,
  the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen also suggest that the coastal
  upwelling is beneficial for the enrichment of nutrients in the upper layer of the
  southwestern Yellow Sea, which is an important environmental trigger for the grow
  of green tide (Ulva prolifera). Furthermore, the numerical model results suggest
  that, beside the southerly summer monsoon and the strong tidal motions, the favorable
  (unfavorable) effects of the local positive (negative) wind stress curl on the coastal
  upwelling should be counted as well. This study provides new scientific data and
  theoretical basis on the mechanisms of the coastal upwelling and the research of
  nitrogen cycle and harmful algal bloom (Ulva prolifera) in the Yellow Sea. Further
  quantitative investigations on the dynamical factors of the upwelling remain to
  be established.
