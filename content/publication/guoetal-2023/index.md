abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated significant increases in atmospheric
  rivers (ARs) over the western North Pacific (WNP) during post–El Niño summers, which
  primarily focus on seasonal-mean features of ARs. Here, we aim to compare the AR
  characteristics during AR-active weeks in post–El Niño and non-post–El Niño summers,
  and to clarify their distinct mechanisms. Our results reveal that the patterns of
  WNP ARs and associated atmospheric and oceanic variabilities vary significantly
  between the two cases. During AR-active weeks in post–El Niño summers, a meridional
  dipole of anomalous geopotential height dominates the WNP with a more westward-located
  WNP subtropical high, resulting in enhanced AR activity extending from southern
  China into the central Pacific. In contrast, during AR-active weeks in non-post–El
  Niño summers, a prominent zonal dipole appears featured by an anomalous low pressure
  over southeast China and an anomalous high pressure over subtropical WNP, together
  with pronounced sea surface temperature (SST) warming to the southeast of Japan
  due to the more downward shortwave radiation. Such anomalous circulation leads to
  more AR occurrence spreading from the northern South China Sea (SCS) to Japan. The
  fraction of rainfall associated with ARs indicates distinct regionality reflecting
  the above AR features, especially over eastern China and Japan. The temporal decomposition
  reveals the basic state plays a more dominant role in the anomalous circulation
  during AR-active weeks in post–El Niño summers than in non-post–El Niño summers.
  Furthermore. the possible impacts of TC in the two cases are also suggested.
