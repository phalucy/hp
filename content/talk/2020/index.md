summary:
abstract: "The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a dominant variability in the tropics on the intra-seasonal scale, which is characterized by an large-scale eastward-propagating convective envelope. Nowadays, many operational atmosphere-ocean coupled models could successfully simulate/predict the MJO[1], while some studies also suggest that the the diurnal-variation-resolved coupling may greatly affect the simulated MJO and its intensity. In this study, with the help of cloud-resolved regional model, we investigate how does the coupling frequency affect the convection during the MJO passage and the possible mechanisms behind by case study of YMC-Sumatra 2017 campaign."
