I'm working at DCOP, RIGC in JAMSTEC as a researcher. I'm interested in the short-term air-sea interactions, including the processes between extra-tropical cyclones and marginal seas, the interactions between the upper ocean and the diurnal cycle within the Maritime Continent, and my recent research interests is the life cycle of the atmospheric rivers (AR).
