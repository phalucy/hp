Ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream, play a pivotal role in heat dispersion and climate stability. Diverse ecosystems, including coral reefs and mangroves, contribute essential services. Positive feedback loops, like methane release and glacier melt, amplify climate change effects, while negative loops, such as ocean heat exchange and adaptive responses, mitigate impacts. Diverse datasets, including satellite observations and climate models, offer a holistic understanding. The study addresses modeling limitations and advocates for a two-pronged approach: global regulations and coordinated efforts for adaptation and mitigation. Successful conservation projects, like marine protected areas and sustainable fisheries management, highlight the need for collaborative global action. The findings stress the human capacity to mitigate climate change consequences through understanding, legislation, and effective conservation. Future research should focus on improving modeling techniques, refining biogeochemical understanding, and exploring diverse emission scenarios to bridge existing knowledge gaps and ensure sustainability.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of Climate Change on the Dynamic Processes of Marine Environment and Feedback Mechanisms: An Overview","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bin Wang","Lijuan Hua","Amal M.

The marine economy, as an important part of economic development, is the breakthrough of economic transformation for many coastal countries. Additionally, green development and environmental impact assessment have become the focus of research in these countries. This study employs remote sensing technology, an efficient observational method, to significantly enhance the efficiency of ocean information observation. It investigates ocean carbon emissions within the framework of carbon neutrality. First, we identified the ships along the coastline based on marine remote sensing information through the YOLO (you only look once) framework. Second, we applied the LSTM (long short-term memory) method to combine the target identification results and the historical data of carbon emissions to complete the corresponding carbon emission data fitting. Finally, carbon emission data from the past three years in the offshore area of Dalian were used to make accurate predictions. The results suggested that the recognition rate of the proposed target detection method could reach 88%, and the LSTM method has shown the best performance in terms of absolute error for the subsequent short-term carbon emission prediction. This framework not only provides essential technical support for analyzing remote sensing information within the context of carbon neutrality but also introduces innovative insights for carbon emission prediction.","tags":["Remote sensing","Ocean carbon emission","YOLO","Machine learning","Environment evaluation"],"title":"Ocean carbon emission prediction and management measures based on artificial intelligence remote sensing estimation in the context of carbon neutrality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao 赵 宁"],"categories":["Sys"],"content":"","date":1700611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700611200,"objectID":"8cb685be7155637e4cee3cbb79fd7b85","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/post/2023-11-22/","publishdate":"2023-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/post/2023-11-22/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":["Sys"],"title":"[2023/11/22] Our recent study (Guo et al. 2023) has been published in Journal of Climate.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao 赵 宁"],"categories":["Sys"],"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"3249bf5e6b15cc9d5f73b09a041ef3e7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/post/2023-11-01/","publishdate":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/post/2023-11-01/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":["Sys"],"title":"[2023/11/01] Our recent study (Seiki et al. 2023) has been published in SOLA.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ayako Seiki","Akira Nagano","Ning Zhao","Iwao Ueki","Satoru Yokoi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700633700,"objectID":"40d0bd929ec64eed21fd8a5440a53911","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/seikietal-2023/","publishdate":"2023-11-22T06:14:30.818887Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/seikietal-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Diurnal SST warming and the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation in the Philippine Sea: contrasts between early and late summer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao 赵 宁"],"categories":["Seminar"],"content":"I’m pleased to give a presentation at Nanjing University and shared my works in tracing moisture sources of heavy rainfalls.

By using the Lagrangian backward trajectories, we found the moisture sources of the three events varied much due to the rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In general, moisture from the Sea of Japan contributed the most in all events, while the western Pacific also played a certain role. Surprisingly, moisture from tropical storms and the East China Sea did not contribute much due to the along-transport precipitation. But, based on forward-traced trajectories, we confirmed that tropical storms did enhance moisture transport from subtropical regions via their southerly wind.

Here, we aim to compare the AR characteristics during AR-active weeks in post–El Niño and non-post–El Niño summers, and to clarify their distinct mechanisms. Our results reveal that the patterns of WNP ARs and associated atmospheric and oceanic variabilities vary significantly between the two cases. During AR-active weeks in post–El Niño summers, a meridional dipole of anomalous geopotential height dominates the WNP with a more westward-located WNP subtropical high, resulting in enhanced AR activity extending from southern China into the central Pacific. In contrast, during AR-active weeks in non-post–El Niño summers, a prominent zonal dipole appears featured by an anomalous low pressure over southeast China and an anomalous high pressure over subtropical WNP, together with pronounced sea surface temperature (SST) warming to the southeast of Japan due to the more downward shortwave radiation. Such anomalous circulation leads to more AR occurrence spreading from the northern South China Sea (SCS) to Japan. The fraction of rainfall associated with ARs indicates distinct regionality reflecting the above AR features, especially over eastern China and Japan. The temporal decomposition reveals the basic state plays a more dominant role in the anomalous circulation during AR-active weeks in post–El Niño summers than in non-post–El Niño summers. Furthermore. the possible impacts of TC in the two cases are also suggested.","tags":[],"title":"Distinct features of atmospheric rivers over the western North Pacific in post–El Niño and non-post–El Niño summers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao 赵 宁"],"categories":["Meeting"],"content":"I attended the APL-ICAR (NUIST) Workshop, which held at Miyoshi Hall, JAMSTEC Yokohama Campus, Japan.\n","date":1691366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691452800,"objectID":"6ac2ebf0befc2445086142a96e261b97","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/post/2023-08-07/","publishdate":"2023-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/post/2023-08-07/","section":"post","summary":"APL-ICAR Workshop","tags":["Meeting"],"title":"[2023/08/07] APL-ICAR Workshop (Aug 7-8) @JAMSTEC","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao 赵 宁"],"categories":["Meeting"],"content":"I attended the 20th Annual Meeting of the Asia Oceania Geosciences Society held in Singapore\n","date":1691020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691366400,"objectID":"462d4d4a6b7fdd04a99c17c9100d54b6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/post/2023-08-03/","publishdate":"2023-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/post/2023-08-03/","section":"post","summary":"AOGS2023","tags":["Meeting"],"title":"[2023/08/03] AOGS2023 in Singapore","type":"post"},{"authors":["Bin Wang","Lijuan, Hua","Huan Mei","Yanyan Kang","Ning ZHao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694143336,"objectID":"eaf9f0e8aa6de20db65a570911340ec5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/wangetal-2023/","publishdate":"2023-09-08T03:22:16.265719Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/wangetal-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine pollution can have a significant impact on the blue carbon, which finally affect the ocean's ability to sequester carbon and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality. Marine pollution is a complex problem that requires a great deal of time and effort to measure. Existing machine learning algorithms cannot effectively solve the detection time problem and provide limited accuracy. Moreover, marine pollution can come from a variety of sources. However, most of the existing research focused on a single ocean indicator to analyze marine pollution. In this study, two indicators, marine organisms and debris, are used to create a more complete picture of the extent and impact of pollution in the ocean. To effectively recognize different marine objects in the complex marine environment, we propose an integrated data fusion approach where deep CNNs are combined to conduct underwater object recognition. Through this multi-source data fusion approach, the accuracy of object recognition is significantly improved. After feature extraction, four machine and deep learning classifiers' performances are used to train on features extracted with deep CNNs. The results show that VGG-16 achieves better performance than other feature extractors when detecting marine organisms. When detecting marine debris, AlexNet outperforms other deep CNNs. The results also show that the LSTM classifier with VGG-16 for detecting marine organisms outperforms other deep learning models. For detecting marine debris, the best performance was observed with the AlexNet extractor, which obtained the best classification result with an LSTM. This information can be used to develop policies and practices aimed at reducing pollution and protecting marine environments for future generations.","tags":[],"title":"Monitoring Marine Pollution for Carbon Neutrality through a Deep Learning Method with Multi-Source Data Fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao 赵 宁"],"categories":["Sys"],"content":"","date":1679356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679356800,"objectID":"be25ae31f5b84e8fa6b0826675c378b6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/post/2023-03-21/","publishdate":"2023-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/post/2023-03-21/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":["Sys"],"title":"[2023/03/21] Our study has been published in Remote Sensing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Xuewei Zhang","Ning Zhao","Zhen Han"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679448860,"objectID":"4d7c7b68dc2284587b58847e4c4be60a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhang-2023/","publishdate":"2023-03-22T01:34:18.596161Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhang-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of oceanic features is always an important issue in oceanography, where deep learning has been proven to be a useful tool. In this study, we applied the improved U-net model to predict the monthly sea surface salinity (SSS) over the western Pacific (WP) Ocean, and the model was designed to use the SSSs from six consecutive months to predict the SSS in the next month. The monthly satellite-based SSSs in 2015–2020 were used for model training, and the data collected after January 2021 were used to evaluate the model’s predictive abilities. The results showed that the predicted SSSs represented the general patterns of SSSs over the WP region. However, the small-scale features were smoothed out in the model, and the temporal variations were also not well captured, especially over the East China Sea and Yellow Sea (ECS\u0026YS) region. To further evaluate the potential of the U-net model, a more specific model was conducted for the ECS\u0026YS region (Domain 2), which successfully predicted both spatial and temporal variations in the SSSs, including the spreading and retreating of the low-salinity tongue. Based on the comparison between the two domains and sensitivity experiments, we found that the prediction biases were contributed by the spatial distributions of the SSSs, the domain size, and the filter numbers. In addition, further multi-step prediction experiments suggested that our U-net model could also be used for long-time prediction, and we have examined up to five months. Overall, this study demonstrated the great ability and potential of the U-net model for predicting SSS, even though only a few trainable data are available.","tags":[],"title":"A Modified U-Net Model for Predicting the Sea Surface Salinity over the Western Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Atsuyoshi Manda","Xiaojun Guo","Bin Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668074034,"objectID":"2b88e9f2565471918199a3b050c3b976","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhaoetal-2022-b/","publishdate":"2022-11-10T09:53:54.149235Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhaoetal-2022-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Our recent study suggested that moisture from the subtropical Western Pacific (WP) contributed the most to an atmospheric river (AR) event and the related heavy rainfall during the heavy rain of 2020 in Japan based on a Lagrangian approach. However, the actual role of moisture from the subtropical WP region in the AR and heavy rain formations remains unclear. To evaluate that, we conducted a set of numerical sensitivity experiments by adjusting the surface moisture supply over the subtropical WP region with factors of 0%, 50%, and 200%. The sensitivity experiments suggest that the reduced surface evaporation over the subtropical WP suppressed the local convective activity and decreased moisture content in the whole troposphere, leading to shallow and weak positive geopotential height anomalies. Although the slightly strengthened WP subtropical High (WPSH) and related anomalous anticyclonic circulation enhanced the southwesterly wind, convective activities along the Meiyu-Baiu front were still weakened due to the largely reduced moisture supply, resulting in another anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Japan but had much stronger and deeper structures. These two anomalous circulations and the reduced moisture modulated the AR over Japan, which eventually caused the weakened rainfalls and the northward migration of the rainband. By contrast, larger surface evaporation enhanced the local convective activities and weakened the dominant WPSH, resulting in the weakening and the southward migration of the AR. Overall, this study confirmed the large contributions of moisture supply from the subtropical WP region to the AR and related precipitation over Japan during the record-breaking Meiyu-Baiu season in 2020 via both dynamic and thermodynamic influences. In addition, it reveals that, although larger evaporation over the WP region would increase the total rainfalls but would not have led to more several rainfalls over certain regions, such as the relatively small Kyushu Island.","tags":[],"title":"Impacts of moisture supply from the subtropical western Pacific on the subtropical high and the atmospheric river during the heavy rain of 2020 in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Peiming Wu","Satoru Yokoi","Miki Hattori"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648701811,"objectID":"f565455a61ca059029bfe9194cdfc341","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhaoetal-2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-31T04:43:31.388831Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhaoetal-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"This study investigated the diurnal cycle of convection over Sumatra Island in an active phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) during the Pre-Years of the Maritime Continent (YMC) observation campaign in December 2015 based on in situ and satellite observations and a convection-permitting numerical model. Observations suggest that before the active phase of the MJO in early December, convection occurred frequently over the island during the afternoon and at midnight. By contrast, during the active phase of the MJO in mid-December, afternoon convection over the island was delayed and suppressed, and midnight convection was suppressed. Numerical experiments also successfully replicated the main features of the observed modulations. In general, during the active phase of the MJO, the troposphere became drier in the Sumatra region. While the clouds reduced the solar radiation over the land, the sea breeze was also found to be delayed and weakened. As a result, the afternoon convection initiation was delayed and weakened. Further analyses suggested that the sea breeze was weakened mainly due to the orographic stagnation effect rather than the slightly reduced land–sea temperature contrast. On the other hand, the increased stratiform-anvil clouds induced the anomalous evaporative cooling in the midtroposphere and generated island-scale subsidence during the nighttime, which finally led to the suppression of inland convection. Overall, our study reveals the modulation of diurnal convection over Sumatra Island by an active phase of the MJO and also shows the potential role of land–sea interaction in convection initiation and maintenance.","tags":[],"title":"Why Does Convection Weaken over Sumatra Island in an Active Phase of the MJO?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Atsuyoshi Manda","Xiaojun Guo","Kazuyoshi Kikuchi","Tomoe Nasuno","Masuo Nakano","Yuanxin Zhang","Bin Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612226951,"objectID":"ab3ef3f93f2d1bb3fe19b68fcf43cab9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-02T00:49:11.536277Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The transport and accumulation of moisture played an essential role in the extremely heavy rainfall of July 2020 in Japan. To better understand this event in terms of moisture sources and transport routes, backward particle trajectory analysis was conducted. We found two major moisture sources: transport from the tropics and uptake from the subtropics. A narrow moisture channel was found along the edge of the western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), transporting the moisture to the Baiu front. However, most moisture from the tropics was lost due to precipitation, and their contributions were reduced to about 15%. In contrast, the subtropical regions contributed over 80% moisture via evaporation and lower tropospheric convection. Among those regions, the western Pacific contributed the most (\u003e 33 %). This study highlights the role of WPSH in moisture transport and demonstrated the importance of moisture uptake during transport.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"A Lagrangian view of moisture transport related to the heavy rainfall of July 2020 in Japan: Importance of the moistening over the subtropical regions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojun Guo","Ning Zhao","Kazuyoshi Kikuchi","Tomoe Nasuno","Masuo Nakano","H.

Diagnosing the 40-yr (1979–2018) ERA5 reanalysis dataset, the present study examines the climatological features of ARs over the Indo-Pacific region during June–October and its associations with the BSISO. Results suggest that the western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) provides a favorable circulation background for the summertime AR activity, which conveys the moisture from the tropics to the midlatitude North Pacific along its periphery. Our analysis reveals that the BSISO has substantial impacts on the occurrence and distribution of ARs. More ARs are found over the western North Pacific (WNP) when the BSISO convective envelope propagates northward to the subtropical regions, while fewer ARs can be seen when convection is suppressed there. Specifically, in phases 7–8, the active BSISO convection over the Philippine Sea induces a low pressure anomaly and the corresponding anomalous cyclonic circulation, leading to the enhanced poleward moisture transport and more frequent AR activity over the WNP. Moreover, the WNP ARs tend to be longer and have larger sizes during these two phases. It is also found that more frequent occurrence of tropical cyclones in phases 7–8 can significantly enhance the moisture transport and AR occurrence over the WNP.","tags":[],"title":"Atmospheric Rivers over the Indo-Pacific and its Associations with Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bin Wang","Lei Wu","Ning Zhao","Tianran Liu","Naoki Hirose"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632194850,"objectID":"7c4ed6fcd49ddc49dc180e89975f764d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/wangetal-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T03:27:30.692603Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/wangetal-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The features of coastal upwelling in the southwestern Yellow Sea were investigated based on oceanology data from a research cruise and a regional circulation model. The observation data suggest that a relatively colder and saltier water core exists from the deeper layer to the surface, off the Subei Bank. The concentrations of nutrients also suggest that coastal upwelling is beneficial for nutrient enrichment in the upper layer. The numerical simulations are in good agreement with oceanology observations. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments indicate that, in addition to the tidal-induced upwelling and tidal mixing proposed in previous studies, the summer monsoon is also critical to vertical circulation in the southwestern Yellow Sea. The southwesterly wind stress and positive wind stress curl make considerable contributions to upwelling off the Subei coast compared with tidal motions. Moreover, this study also proposes that changes in the summer monsoon and its curl may have been helpful to the formation of upwelling during the past decade, which may have provided a favorable marine environment for the frequent occurrence of green tides. This study provides a theoretical basis for the mechanisms of coastal upwelling and the nitrogen cycle in the Yellow Sea.","tags":[],"title":"Summer Wind Effects on Coastal Upwelling in the Southwestern Yellow Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Clarify the role of the sub-daily scale air-sea interaction on the convection (both diurnal cycle and the Madden–Julian oscillation) and upper ocean in the tropical regions.\n","date":1589846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589846400,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"科研費・若手研究","tags":["kakenhi"],"title":"海大陸における対流活動に対する日周期大気海洋相互作用の役割の解明","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Nasuno Tomoe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584316800,"objectID":"dee62db854e0bb119f5d3dea13f457bd","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The importance of air-sea coupling in the simulation and prediction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) has been well established. However, it remains unclear how air-sea coupling modulates the convection and related oceanic features on the subdaily scale. Based on a regional cloud-permitting coupled model, we evaluated the impact of the air-sea coupling on the convection during the convectively active phase of the MJO by varying the coupling frequency. The model successfully reproduced the atmospheric and oceanic variations observed by satellite and in situ measurements but with some quantitative biases. According to the sensitivity experiments, we found that stronger convection was mainly caused by the higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs) generated in high-frequency coupled experiments, especially when the coupling frequency was 1 hr or shorter. A lower coupling frequency would generate the phase lags in the diurnal cycle of SST and related turbulent heat fluxes. Our analyses further demonstrated that the phase-lagged diurnal cycle of SST suppressed deep convection through a decrease in daytime moistening in the lower troposphere. Meanwhile, in the upper ocean, the high-frequency air-sea coupling helped maintain the shallower mixed and isothermal layers by diurnal heating and cooling at the sea surface, which led to a higher mean SST. In contrast, the low-frequency coupled experiments underestimated the SST and therefore convective activities. Overall, our results demonstrated that high-frequency air-sea coupling (1 hr or shorter) could improve the reproducibility of the intensity and temporal variation in both diurnal convection and upper ocean processes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"How does the air-sea coupling frequency affect convection during the MJO passage?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Nasuno Tomoe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581984000,"objectID":"358b522af2f4efc6953fe86b07ab68cb","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2020/","section":"talk","summary":"The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a dominant variability in the tropics on the intra-seasonal scale, which is characterized by an large-scale eastward-propagating convective envelope.

The model was conducted with and without an SST anomaly due to cooling from a single extratropical cyclone in winter. Twenty-six pairs of sensitivity experiments demonstrated that cyclones were not always sensitive to the SST anomaly. The low-level trough (strong northwesterly winds) affected cyclone sensitivity via a cold air intrusion over the Sea of Japan. A strong (weak) cold air intrusion formed a relatively unstable (stable) and higher (lower) convective layer and the concentration of cyclone paths over the oceans, making the cyclones sensitive to the underlying SST. Two specific cyclones were analyzed to demonstrate two distinct patterns (wave-like and path shifting, respectively) in cyclone modulations revealed in the wavelet spectra. The wave-like pattern was formed by the superposition of multiple anomalous waves with different periods and scales, which originated from upper-level potential vorticity anomalies and temperature advection. The path-shifting pattern was caused by the diabatic heating-induced potential vorticity anomalies, which were supplied by the intense heat and moisture from the regions surrounding the Sea of Japan. Therefore, a cyclone can modulate a following cyclone by reducing the SST over the Sea of Japan; however, the modulation can vary in different ways, depending on the atmospheric background and dynamics of the cyclone development.","tags":["extratropical cyclones","Sea of Japan","air-sea interactions","cyclone-induced SST anomaly"],"title":"Modulation of Extratropical Cyclones by Previous Cyclones via the Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly Over the Sea of Japan in Winter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe","and Masaru Yamamoto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1518393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518393600,"objectID":"539be5f59672b69b3436704c95e8f299","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2018a/","publishdate":"2018-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2018a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Sub-weekly Scale Interactions between the Sea of Japan and Extra-tropical Cyclones in Winter","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504310400,"objectID":"6bad34c634f4c314a126606faf479f9c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2017a/","publishdate":"2017-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2017a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"冬季東アジア周辺の温帯低気圧による海面水温変化・新たな可能性","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495238400,"objectID":"62d26335bf3b935e9aa4af8b7334bc9d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2017b/","publishdate":"2017-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2017b/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["poster"],"title":"Effect of SST in the Sea of Japan on the Winter Cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491868800,"objectID":"90211b3837d6d6388561a13a951b2993","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2017c/","publishdate":"2017-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2017c/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Effect of SST in the Sea of Japan on the Winter Cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477440000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477440000,"objectID":"da6381c9d45e124bdeb8cd4b92c3faba","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2016a/","publishdate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2016a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Effect of SST in the Sea of Japan on the Winter Cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472860800,"objectID":"1e3b500e821e3c2e73f01c2bdf788754","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2016b/","publishdate":"2016-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2016b/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"温帯低気圧における日本海の海面水温変化","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe","Ren-Chieh Lien","Bin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1458000000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1458000000,"objectID":"f3d4239eb22398136f859fec049bacf8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2016-a/","publishdate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2016-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The response of the subpolar front in the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea) to winter cyclones is investigated based on quantitative analyses of gridded and satellite data sets.

After removal of sea surface temperature (SST) seasonal trends, we found that cyclone passage (hence, cooling) mainly occurred over 3 days, with maximum SST reduction of −0.4°C. The greatest reduction was found along the subpolar front, where frontal sharpness (i.e., SST gradient) increased by 0.1°C (100 km)−1. Results of a mixed-layer model were consistent with both temperature and frontal sharpness, and localized surface cooling along the subpolar front resulted from both horizontal heat advection and turbulent heat fluxes at the sea surface. Further analyses show that this localized cooling from horizontal heat advection is caused by the cross-frontal Ekman flow (vertically averaged over the mixed layer) and strong northwesterly winds associated with the cold-air outbreak during cyclone passage.","tags":["extratropical cyclone","subpolar front","Sea of Japan","front intensification"],"title":"Intensification of the subpolar front in the Sea of Japan during winter cyclones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Zhen Han","Xianbo Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1452816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1452816000,"objectID":"b3744fe4f1bee0e567c8f99737a1dbbc","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2016-b/","publishdate":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2016-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Preliminary study on the frontogenesis and frontolysis of the oceanic temperature front in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443139200,"objectID":"3d9b4bef0fcdd1e88fcb9da5ccbcd39a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2015a/","publishdate":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2015a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Intensification of the subpolar front in the Japan Sea during the winter cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Zhen Han"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"ddb44c7792d0d09bc60753782590b01a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2015/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"This study proposed a neural-network-based model to estimate the ocean vertical water temperature from the surface temperature in the northwest Pacific Ocean.

When counting with errors lower than ± 1°C, the lowest percentage was 83%.","tags":null,"title":"A simulation model of seawater vertical temperature by using back-propagation neural network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1436400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1436400000,"objectID":"5726e424a1eec1ae88444210142b6a21","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/talk/2015b/","publishdate":"2015-07-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2015b/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Intensification of the subpolar front in the Japan Sea during the winter cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Zhen Han","Song Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409529600,"objectID":"7d5a8d9d35c0cc546a6c70f8bfd31807","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2014-b/","publishdate":"2014-09-01T05:52:31.387715Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2014-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["seawater temperature","segment-based model","relative gradient method"],"title":"A segment-based seawater temperature model by using the relative gradient method","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1405296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1405296000,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2014-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"Recent Project of our group.","tags":["other"],"title":"Years of the Maritime Continent","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Atsuyoshi Manda","Zhen Han"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1392076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1392076800,"objectID":"36c823bc734f9a160a62771448e8de44","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2014-a/","publishdate":"2014-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2014-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The frontogenesis and frontolysis processes of the subpolar front (SPF) in the surface mixed layer of the Japan Sea are investigated using state-of-the-art oceanic reanalysis data. The SPF experiences a 9 month weakening period from January to September, which shifts to a strengthening period in October. Our analysis shows that horizontal advection consistently contributes to the intensification of the SPF. After September, as the weakening effect of surface heat flux diminishes, horizontal advection becomes the dominant factor that contributes to changes in the SPF strength. Thus, the SPF enters a 3 month strengthening period. The geostrophic component of horizontal advection provides the most important contribution to strengthening the SPF, acting to intensify the SPF year-round. Ekman advection also promotes SPF strengthening with a smaller but still important contribution. During the weakening period, SPF strength is largely controlled by heat flux. The heat flux, especially the shortwave radiation component, is the primary cause of the surface front disappearance in the summer.","tags":["subpolar front","frontolysis","frontogenesis","the Japan Sea"],"title":"Frontogenesis and frontolysis of the subpolar front in the surface mixed layer of the Japan Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Han","Ning Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343779200,"objectID":"581b0ec60c744a3fc2b65d5e242d4e6f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hp/publication/zhao-2012/","publishdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Seawater temperature model from Argo data by LM-BP neural network in Northwest Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"}]
