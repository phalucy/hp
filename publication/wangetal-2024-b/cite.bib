 abstract = {This study explores the intricate relationship between climate change, marine dynamic processes, and feedback mechanisms, emphasizing the marine environmentâ€™s crucial role in global climate regulation and biodiversity support. Ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream, play a pivotal role in heat dispersion and climate stability. Diverse ecosystems, including coral reefs and mangroves, contribute essential services. Positive feedback loops, like methane release and glacier melt, amplify climate change effects, while negative loops, such as ocean heat exchange and adaptive responses, mitigate impacts. Diverse datasets, including satellite observations and climate models, offer a holistic understanding. The study addresses modeling limitations and advocates for a two-pronged approach: global regulations and coordinated efforts for adaptation and mitigation. Successful conservation projects, like marine protected areas and sustainable fisheries management, highlight the need for collaborative global action. The findings stress the human capacity to mitigate climate change consequences through understanding, legislation, and effective conservation. Future research should focus on improving modeling techniques, refining biogeochemical understanding, and exploring diverse emission scenarios to bridge existing knowledge gaps and ensure sustainability.},
