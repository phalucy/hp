 abstract = {Abstract Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that occur in the Baiu frontal zone (BFZ) can cause devastating flash floods during early summer in Japan; however, the environmental conditions necessary for their development require further investigation. High-frequency atmospheric soundings, conducted using multiple marine vessels in the East China Sea on 19 June 2022, captured the detailed environmental conditions pertaining to the development of an MCS within the BFZ. The MCS, which developed rapidly without any remarkable preceding synoptic or mesoscale disturbance in the mid- or upper troposphere, caused intense precipitation exceeding 80 mm/hr. The MCS persisted for approximately 6 hr, and it intensified when the influx of nearly saturated air near the sea surface toward a weak surface front overlapped with the influx of free-tropospheric moist air. The influx of nearly saturated air near the sea surface ensured conditional instability within the lower troposphere. The influx of moist air in the free troposphere contributed to the near-saturation conditions above the boundary layer, a feature inherent to the BFZ, and played an important role in minimizing the reduction in the buoyancy of air parcels. The results of this study indicate that a better forecast of the horizontal distribution of free tropospheric moist air is beneficial for limiting the potential area of genesis of MCS in the BFZ, and a more comprehensive understanding of the vertical variations in moisture transport contributes to an improved forecast skill for MCS in the BFZ.},
