ABSTRACT = {In August 2022, the Tohoku region of Japan suffered three major heavy rainfall events, while one was related to an anticyclone, and the others were induced by a ‘Baiu-like’ stationary front. By using the Lagrangian backward trajectories, we found the moisture sources of the three events varied much due to the rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In general, moisture from the Sea of Japan contributed the most in all events, while the western Pacific also played a certain role. Surprisingly, moisture from tropical storms and the East China Sea did not contribute much due to the along-transport precipitation. But, based on forward-traced trajectories, we confirmed that tropical storms did enhance moisture transport from subtropical regions via their southerly wind. Overall, this study highlights the role of the moisture gains nearby and the outer flows of tropical storms during heavy rainfalls in a northern region.},
