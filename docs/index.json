Observations suggest that before the active phase of the MJO in early December, convection occurred frequently over the island during the afternoon and at midnight. By contrast, during the active phase of the MJO in mid-December, afternoon convection over the island was delayed and suppressed, and midnight convection was suppressed. Numerical experiments also successfully replicated the main features of the observed modulations. In general, during the active phase of the MJO, the troposphere became drier in the Sumatra region. While the clouds reduced the solar radiation over the land, the sea breeze was also found to be delayed and weakened. As a result, the afternoon convection initiation was delayed and weakened. Further analyses suggested that the sea breeze was weakened mainly due to the orographic stagnation effect rather than the slightly reduced land-sea temperature contrast. On the other hand, the increased stratiform-anvil clouds induced the anomalous evaporative cooling in the mid-troposphere and generated island-scale subsidence during the nighttime, which finally led to the suppression of inland convection. Overall, our study reveals the modulation of diurnal convection over Sumatra Island by an active phase of the MJO and also shows the potential role of land-sea interaction in convection initiation and maintenance.","tags":[],"title":"Why does convection weaken over Sumatra Island in an active phase of the MJO?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Atsuyoshi Manda","Xiaojun Guo","Kazuyoshi Kikuchi","Tomoe Nasuno","Masuo Nakano","Yuanxin Zhang","Bin Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612228550,"objectID":"ab3ef3f93f2d1bb3fe19b68fcf43cab9","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/publication/zhao-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-02T00:49:11.536277Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The transport and accumulation of moisture played an essential role in the extremely heavy rainfall of July 2020 in Japan. To better understand this event in terms of moisture sources and transport routes, backward particle trajectory analysis was conducted. We found two major moisture sources: transport from the tropics and uptake from the subtropics. A narrow moisture channel was found along the edge of the western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), transporting the moisture to the Baiu front. However, most moisture from the tropics was lost due to precipitation, and their contributions were reduced to about 15%. In contrast, the subtropical regions contributed over 80% moisture via evaporation and lower tropospheric convection. Among those regions, the western Pacific contributed the most ( 33 %). This study highlights the role of WPSH in moisture transport and demonstrated the importance of moisture uptake during transport.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"A Lagrangian view of moisture transport related to the heavy rainfall of July 2020 in Japan: Importance of the moistening over the subtropical regions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojun Guo","Ning Zhao","Kazuyoshi Kikuchi","Tomoe Nasuno","Masuo Nakano","H.

The observation data suggest that a relatively colder and saltier water core exists from the deeper layer to the surface, off the Subei Bank. The concentrations of nutrients also suggest that coastal upwelling is beneficial for nutrient enrichment in the upper layer. The numerical simulations are in good agreement with oceanology observations. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments indicate that, in addition to the tidal-induced upwelling and tidal mixing proposed in previous studies, the summer monsoon is also critical to vertical circulation in the southwestern Yellow Sea. The southwesterly wind stress and positive wind stress curl make considerable contributions to upwelling off the Subei coast compared with tidal motions. Moreover, this study also proposes that changes in the summer monsoon and its curl may have been helpful to the formation of upwelling during the past decade, which may have provided a favorable marine environment for the frequent occurrence of green tides. This study provides a theoretical basis for the mechanisms of coastal upwelling and the nitrogen cycle in the Yellow Sea.","tags":[],"title":"Summer Wind Effects on Coastal Upwelling in the Southwestern Yellow Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Clarify the role of the sub-daily scale air-sea interaction on the convection (both diurnal cycle and the Madden–Julian oscillation) and upper ocean in the tropical regions.\n","date":1589846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"科研費・若手研究","tags":["kakenhi"],"title":"海大陸における対流活動に対する日周期大気海洋相互作用の役割の解明","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Nasuno Tomoe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592382728,"objectID":"dee62db854e0bb119f5d3dea13f457bd","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/publication/zhao-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The importance of air-sea coupling in the simulation and prediction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) has been well established. However, it remains unclear how air-sea coupling modulates the convection and related oceanic features on the subdaily scale. Based on a regional cloud-permitting coupled model, we evaluated the impact of the air-sea coupling on the convection during the convectively active phase of the MJO by varying the coupling frequency. The model successfully reproduced the atmospheric and oceanic variations observed by satellite and in situ measurements but with some quantitative biases. According to the sensitivity experiments, we found that stronger convection was mainly caused by the higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs) generated in high-frequency coupled experiments, especially when the coupling frequency was 1 hr or shorter. A lower coupling frequency would generate the phase lags in the diurnal cycle of SST and related turbulent heat fluxes. Our analyses further demonstrated that the phase-lagged diurnal cycle of SST suppressed deep convection through a decrease in daytime moistening in the lower troposphere. Meanwhile, in the upper ocean, the high-frequency air-sea coupling helped maintain the shallower mixed and isothermal layers by diurnal heating and cooling at the sea surface, which led to a higher mean SST. In contrast, the low-frequency coupled experiments underestimated the SST and therefore convective activities. Overall, our results demonstrated that high-frequency air-sea coupling (1 hr or shorter) could improve the reproducibility of the intensity and temporal variation in both diurnal convection and upper ocean processes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"How does the air-sea coupling frequency affect convection during the MJO passage?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Nasuno Tomoe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"358b522af2f4efc6953fe86b07ab68cb","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2020/","section":"talk","summary":"The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a dominant variability in the tropics on the intra-seasonal scale, which is characterized by an large-scale eastward-propagating convective envelope.

The model was conducted with and without an SST anomaly due to cooling from a single extratropical cyclone in winter. Twenty-six pairs of sensitivity experiments demonstrated that cyclones were not always sensitive to the SST anomaly. The low-level trough (strong northwesterly winds) affected cyclone sensitivity via a cold air intrusion over the Sea of Japan. A strong (weak) cold air intrusion formed a relatively unstable (stable) and higher (lower) convective layer and the concentration of cyclone paths over the oceans, making the cyclones sensitive to the underlying SST. Two specific cyclones were analyzed to demonstrate two distinct patterns (wave-like and path shifting, respectively) in cyclone modulations revealed in the wavelet spectra. The wave-like pattern was formed by the superposition of multiple anomalous waves with different periods and scales, which originated from upper-level potential vorticity anomalies and temperature advection. The path-shifting pattern was caused by the diabatic heating-induced potential vorticity anomalies, which were supplied by the intense heat and moisture from the regions surrounding the Sea of Japan. Therefore, a cyclone can modulate a following cyclone by reducing the SST over the Sea of Japan; however, the modulation can vary in different ways, depending on the atmospheric background and dynamics of the cyclone development.","tags":["extratropical cyclones","Sea of Japan","air-sea interactions","cyclone-induced SST anomaly"],"title":"Modulation of Extratropical Cyclones by Previous Cyclones via the Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly Over the Sea of Japan in Winter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe","and Masaru Yamamoto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1518393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"539be5f59672b69b3436704c95e8f299","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2018a/","publishdate":"2018-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2018a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Sub-weekly Scale Interactions between the Sea of Japan and Extra-tropical Cyclones in Winter","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"6bad34c634f4c314a126606faf479f9c","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2017a/","publishdate":"2017-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2017a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"冬季東アジア周辺の温帯低気圧による海面水温変化・新たな可能性","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"62d26335bf3b935e9aa4af8b7334bc9d","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2017b/","publishdate":"2017-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2017b/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["poster"],"title":"Effect of SST in the Sea of Japan on the Winter Cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491868800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"90211b3837d6d6388561a13a951b2993","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2017c/","publishdate":"2017-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2017c/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Effect of SST in the Sea of Japan on the Winter Cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477440000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"da6381c9d45e124bdeb8cd4b92c3faba","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2016a/","publishdate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2016a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Effect of SST in the Sea of Japan on the Winter Cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"1e3b500e821e3c2e73f01c2bdf788754","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2016b/","publishdate":"2016-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2016b/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"温帯低気圧における日本海の海面水温変化","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe","Ren-Chieh Lien","Bin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1458000000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592384991,"objectID":"f3d4239eb22398136f859fec049bacf8","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/publication/zhao-2016-a/","publishdate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2016-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The response of the subpolar front in the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea) to winter cyclones is investigated based on quantitative analyses of gridded and satellite data sets.

After removal of sea surface temperature (SST) seasonal trends, we found that cyclone passage (hence, cooling) mainly occurred over 3 days, with maximum SST reduction of −0.4°C. The greatest reduction was found along the subpolar front, where frontal sharpness (i.e., SST gradient) increased by 0.1°C (100 km)−1. Results of a mixed-layer model were consistent with both temperature and frontal sharpness, and localized surface cooling along the subpolar front resulted from both horizontal heat advection and turbulent heat fluxes at the sea surface. Further analyses show that this localized cooling from horizontal heat advection is caused by the cross-frontal Ekman flow (vertically averaged over the mixed layer) and strong northwesterly winds associated with the cold-air outbreak during cyclone passage.","tags":["extratropical cyclone","subpolar front","Sea of Japan","front intensification"],"title":"Intensification of the subpolar front in the Sea of Japan during winter cyclones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Zhen Han","Xianbo Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1452816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592384991,"objectID":"b3744fe4f1bee0e567c8f99737a1dbbc","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/publication/zhao-2016-b/","publishdate":"2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2016-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Preliminary study on the frontogenesis and frontolysis of the oceanic temperature front in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Shinsuke Iwasaki","Atsuhiko Isobe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592301622,"objectID":"3d9b4bef0fcdd1e88fcb9da5ccbcd39a","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/talk/2015a/","publishdate":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/talk/2015a/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["oral"],"title":"Intensification of the subpolar front in the Japan Sea during the winter cyclones","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ning Zhao","Zhen Han"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592384991,"objectID":"ddb44c7792d0d09bc60753782590b01a","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/publication/zhao-2015/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"This study proposed a neural-network-based model to estimate the ocean vertical water temperature from the surface temperature in the northwest Pacific Ocean.

The SPF experiences a 9 month weakening period from January to September, which shifts to a strengthening period in October. Our analysis shows that horizontal advection consistently contributes to the intensification of the SPF. After September, as the weakening effect of surface heat flux diminishes, horizontal advection becomes the dominant factor that contributes to changes in the SPF strength. Thus, the SPF enters a 3 month strengthening period. The geostrophic component of horizontal advection provides the most important contribution to strengthening the SPF, acting to intensify the SPF year-round. Ekman advection also promotes SPF strengthening with a smaller but still important contribution. During the weakening period, SPF strength is largely controlled by heat flux. The heat flux, especially the shortwave radiation component, is the primary cause of the surface front disappearance in the summer.","tags":["subpolar front","frontolysis","frontogenesis","the Japan Sea"],"title":"Frontogenesis and frontolysis of the subpolar front in the surface mixed layer of the Japan Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Han","Ning Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592384991,"objectID":"581b0ec60c744a3fc2b65d5e242d4e6f","permalink":"https://phalucy.github.io/hp/publication/zhao-2012/","publishdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hp/publication/zhao-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Seawater temperature model from Argo data by LM-BP neural network in Northwest Pacific Ocean","type":"publication"}]
